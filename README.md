# IDGenerator

This is my second app for public service.

__Goal:__ To generate a case ID for the customer to track the progress of his or her case. The ID allows him or her to access the progress report of the case. 

__Input:__ The first name and the surname (String in Thai) of the customer, and the current time from the computer clock.

__Output:__ A unique case ID, which combines the first English chracter of the name, surname, and 8-digit time-based serial number.
